Marabou is a cross platform audio tagger written in Java.

It uses SWT to provide a native look and feel on all major platforms.

Marabou is still under development, we have to solve some problems before we can release it to the end user.

Some problems are:

* multi platform installers for 32 and 64 systems are not yet there
* we need to complete some features
* we need to cleanup the code
* currently we only support *.mp3 files (via mp3agic)
