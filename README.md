Marabou is a cross platform audio tagger written in Java.

It uses SWT to provide a native look and feel on all major platforms.

Marabou is still under development, there is no stable release out yet, sorry.

If you want to give the snapshot a try, clone the project and run:

mvn clean package && java -jar target/marabou-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
