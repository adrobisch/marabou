-= Getting started =-

To get started developing marabou for the first time do the following:

- check it out via git
- install maven
- change into the marabou dir and run maven. This will download all dependencies and their sourcode and javadoc if available:
mvn -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true clean
Yes, this take quite a while...

 - if you use eclipse read on below
 - if not, that's it!

-= Eclipse =-

If you run mvn for the first time or switch your workspace you need to make eclipse know where your maven repo is:
mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-your-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo

Create an eclipse project from the maven project:
mvn eclipse:clean
mvn eclipse:eclipse

-=recreate the eclipse project (e.g. if you edited the pom.xml or if a dependency got updated)=-
mvn eclipse:clean
mvn eclipse:eclipse

-= Misc maven stuff =-

fetch all dependencies, remove old builds, compile the code, run the tests and package marabou into a jar file:
mvn clean package

create a jar file including the sourcecode only:
mvn source:jar

create a jar file including the javadoc only:
mvn javadoc:jar

-= Translations and maven =-

parse all .java files and generate a keyfile:
mvn gettext:gettext

?probably? needed to update the po files:
mvn gettext:merge

make class files from the po files:
mvn gettext:dist
