-= Getting started =-

To get started developing marabou for the first time do the following:

- check it out via git
git clone https://github.com/hennr/marabou.git

- install maven
- change into the marabou dir and download all dependencies, their source code and their javadoc, if available:

mvn dependency:sources
mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc

Yes, this takes quite a while...

 - if you use eclipse read on below
 - if not, that's it!

-= Eclipse =-

If you run mvn for the first time or switched your workspace you need to make eclipse know where your maven repo is:
mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-your-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo

Let maven create an eclipse project for you:
mvn eclipse:eclipse

This can be imported into eclispe now.

-=recreate the eclipse project (e.g. if you edited the pom.xml or if a dependency got updated)=-
mvn eclipse:clean
mvn eclipse:eclipse

-= Misc maven stuff =-

fetch all dependencies, remove old builds, compile the code, run the tests and package marabou into a jar file:
mvn clean package

create a jar file including the sourcecode only:
mvn source:jar

create a jar file including the javadoc only:
mvn javadoc:jar

-= Translations and maven =-

parse all .java files and generate a keyfile:
mvn gettext:gettext

?probably? needed to update the po files:
mvn gettext:merge

make class files from the po files:
mvn gettext:dist


-= Loglevels of java.util.logging =-

    SEVERE (highest level)
    WARNING
    INFO
    CONFIG
    FINE
    FINER
    FINEST (lowest level)
